            <h3>Milton, NY Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>In 1802 Charles Millard had two sawmills specializing in white pine. In the summer timber arrived in rafts sent down river from Glens Falls, Fort Edward, and around Lake Champlain. In winter most of the lumber was shipped from the east side of the river hauled by teams over the ice. In 1824 Charles Millard moved across the river to New Hamburg, establishing a lumber yard there. His son Walter carried on the business on the west side. Millard and Mills' steamboat Splendid sailed daily from the Milton dock.</p>
